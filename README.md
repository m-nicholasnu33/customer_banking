Module 3 Challenge Repository

I did utilize a tutoring session to discuss conceptual questions I was having regarding the calling, return, and passing of information between modular files.  The substance of the session was specifically focused on review of in-class activities to help me understand the concepts.  

As such, I was able take the learnings from the review of in-class activities, and apply the concepts on my own to complete the requirements of the Module 3 challenge.
